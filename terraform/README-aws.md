# How to use the AWS terraform setup.

## Files in the archive

* `aws.tfvars.example`

  An example file demonstrating the variables the user can (and in
  some cases 'has to') modify to get a proper setup.

* `aws.tf`, `aws-spot.tf`, `aws-proxy.tf`, `aws-spot-proxy.tf`

  The main terraform configuration, containing the fixed parts of the
  setup. Several variants are possible, distinguished by name:

  Name | Meaning
  ---|---
  aws | single-node u-cloud using regular instances
  aws-spot | ditto, using spot instances (less expensive)
  aws-proxy | 2-node u-cloud, proxy and core, using regular instances
  aws-spot-proxy | ditto, using spot instances (less expensive)

* `hcf-aws.tf.json`

  The cluster definition, generated from HCF's `roles-manifest.yml`.

* `container-host-files`

  Scripts and configuration files uploaded into the Âµcloud to support
  its provisioning.

## Setting up docker


# log in:
Replace USER, PASSWORD and REGISTRY with information given to you by the HCF team.
docker login -u USER -p PASSWORD REGISTRY

In the hcf dir of an hcf vagrant box:
export GIT_BRANCH=something # like dickh-dev
make tag
make publish

make show-docker-setup # shows how the vars in aws.tfvars should be set:
hcf_version="dickh-dev" # or whatever GIT_BRANCH was set to

## Usage

* Copy `aws.tfvars.example` to `aws.tfvars` and then edit the
  configuration to suit the environment (keys, etc). See the
  comments in the file itself.

  Note: If a filename other than `aws.tfvars` is chosen then all
  instances of `aws.tfvars` in the commands below must be replaced
  with the actual name of the file.

* Ensure that the following variables for access to Amazon AWS in
  general are defined in the local environment, with the information
  of the user doing the access:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..." 
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```

  This information can be extracted from AWS when the user in question
  is created.

* Run

```bash
   terraform plan -var-file=aws.tfvars .
```

  This checks that everything is ok. Terraform should __not__ ask for
  the value of any variable.

* Run

```bash
   terraform apply -var-file=aws.tfvars .
```

  to set up the specified configration.


# Troublespots

## Certificates and other secrets

To use the development secrets (instead of supplying your own in
`aws.tfvars`), regenerate `hcf-aws.tf.json` with them built in:

```bash
  make aws ENV_DIR=$PWD/bin
```

## Terraform

If you see

```
  Errors:
    * provider.aws: : invalid or unknown key: insecure
```

upgrade your installation of ```terraform``` to version 0.6.12 or
higher.

## ACL destruction

TF claims that it is sucessfully destroying the ACL.

It is not.

The ACL must be destroyed manually.

See next section for information about the AWS web console.

## AWS Web console

The important sections are EC2 and VPC.

      * Your VPC
      * Subnets
      * Internet Gateway
      * Network ACLs
